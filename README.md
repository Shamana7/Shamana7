# 👋 Hi, I'm Shamana

> "From my first ToDo app to complex infotainment apps, every line of code gave me a reason to stay up, to show up, and to keep going—against all odds, limits, and doubts—turning my persistence into purpose."

I'm an Android developer who codes not just for logic, but for feeling—every screen I build carries a piece of me. Currently building infotainment apps at Harman International for the MSIL project.
