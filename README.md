# 👋 Hi, I'm Shamana

> "From my first ToDo app to complex infotainment apps, every line of code gave me a reason to stay up, to show up, and to keep going—against all odds, limits, and doubts."

I'm an Android developer who codes not just for logic, but for feeling.   
Currently building infotainment apps at Harman International for the MSIL project.

🚀 Recently contributed to [ComposeCookBook — added infinite backward scrolling to the Carousel Pager](https://github.com/Gurupreet/ComposeCookBook/pull/177)
